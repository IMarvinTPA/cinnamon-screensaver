HACKING
=======

Cinnamon-Screensaver is normally build using dpkg. If using Linux Mint, Ubuntu,
or any other member of the Debian family, install the `devscripts` package with
 `sudo apt-get install devscripts`.

Other commands that may be needed to run to get it to build:
  `sudo apt install dh-make`
  `sudo apt install dh-python`
  `sudo apt install gobject-introspection`
  `sudo apt install meson`
  `sudo apt install cmake`
  `sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev`
  `sudo apt install libxdo-dev`
  `sudo apt install libgirepository1.0-dev`



Once you have devscripts, run `debuild -us -uc` to build cinnamon-screensaver
(or any other cinnamon package) and `sudo dpkg -i ../cinnamon-screensaver_{version}_{arch}.deb`
to install.
